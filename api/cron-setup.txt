# Cron Job Setup for Archive of Meme
# Add this line to your server's crontab to run the archive script daily at 20:00 UTC

# For production server (runs at 20:00 UTC every day):
0 20 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/archive-of-meme/api/daily-archive.php >> /path/to/logs/archive.log 2>&1

# Alternative using wget if PHP CLI is not available:
0 20 * * * wget -q -O - https://yourdomain.com/api/daily-archive.php >> /path/to/logs/archive.log 2>&1

# For testing (runs every 5 minutes):
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/archive-of-meme/api/daily-archive.php >> /path/to/logs/archive.log 2>&1

# Notes:
# 1. Replace /path/to/ with your actual server paths
# 2. Make sure the logs directory exists and is writable
# 3. The archive script will only work during the archive phase (20:00-00:00 UTC)
# 4. For Hostinger, use their Cron Jobs panel in hPanel
